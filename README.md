# NERIC — Personal Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and journey as a self-taught developer. I'm Neric, a solo full-stack developer with over 2 years of experience in modern web technologies.

## 🔥 About Me

I specialize in building fast, clean, and scalable web applications using:

- 🟢 Node.js for backend logic and APIs
- ⚛️ React.js for interactive UIs
- 💨 Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design
- 🐘 Simple PHP for lightweight dynamic pages

I've worked independently from the beginning of my coding journey — without financial backing, mentorship, or external support. Every line of code here reflects persistence, self-learning, and the desire to grow despite the odds.
